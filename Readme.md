# The Raven Queen's Chosen: Shadar-Kai 2.3.0

## Introduction
This mod aims to bring in the Shadar-Kai as described in Mordenkainen's Tome of
Foes and Multiverse of Monsters. They're portrayed here as an elven subrace,
though they're more like distant cousins from the Shadowfell.

## To Be a Shadar-Kai
As a Shadar-Kai, you receive the base racial bonuses of Elves. You also have
an additional +1 to Constitution, resistance to Necrotic damage, and the Action
Blessing of the Raven Queen.

## Blessing of the Raven Queen
You begin with an Action, Blessing of the Raven Queen. This Action allows you to
teleport up to 9m to any unoccupied space that you can see, as many times as your
proficiency bonus per long rest.

Upon reaching Level 3, whenever you use this Action, you gain resistance to all
damage until the start of your next turn.

## Requirements
